I created a web Weather app in order to present to the end user the current local weather.
I have 3 files.
main.css , main.html , main.js
main.css: contains all the styling of the UI
main.html:has the DOM and the structure of the App ,script integrated inside the HTML
main.jS: has the whole javascript,jQuery code which i used to call the JSONS and geolocations.

Enjoy!
